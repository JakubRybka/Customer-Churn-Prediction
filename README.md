# Customer Churn Prediction

This project analyzes customer behavior and predicts churn using a machine learning model based on [telecom service data]( https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hassanelfattmi/why-do-customers-leave-can-you-spot-the-churners), It includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), preprocessing, and training a Random Forest classifier, with a focus on contract type, satisfaction, revenue, and customer demographics.

## Project Overview

Customer churn prediction is critical for customer retention strategies. This project aims to:

- Merge and clean multiple datasets (Customer Info, Online Services, Payments, etc., excluding satisfactory parameter for bigger challenge)
- Explore patterns affecting churn (contracts, satisfaction, dependents, etc.)
- Build a machine learning model to predict churn
- Evaluate the model's performance and interpret insights

## Project Structure

```
 data/
   â”œâ”€â”€ Customer_Info.csv
   â”œâ”€â”€ Online_Services.csv
   â”œâ”€â”€ Payment_Info.csv
   â”œâ”€â”€ Service_Options.csv
   â””â”€â”€ Status_Analysis.csv

 churn_analysis.py     # Data loading, preprocessing, model training
 acc.csv               # Model predictions and classification accuracy
 Churn_EDA.pbix        # Explanatory Data analysis in PowerBI
```

##  Features

- **EDA Dashboard** (Power BI) with insights on:
  - Contract type vs churn
  - Age and satisfaction trends
  - Revenue distribution
  - Dependents and churn likelihood
- **Data Pipeline** with:
  - Merging & preprocessing of multiple sources
  - Categorical encoding & normalization
  - Churn classification using Random Forest

---

##  Model Performance

- **Accuracy**: ~80.9% correct predictions on test split
- Balanced performance with insights into misclassifications (classified vs unclassified)
- Churn prediction visualized in pie charts and revenue/satisfaction plots

##  How to Use

1. **Clone the repo**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JakubRybka/churn-prediction.git
   cd churn-prediction
   ```

2. **Place CSV data** into the `data/` folder as listed above.

3. **Run the script**:
   ```bash
   python churn_analysis.py
   ```

4. **View Outputs**:
   - `acc.csv`: Contains predicted vs actual churn and classification result.
   - `eda_dashboard.png`: Visual representation of patterns (optional, provided).

##  Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- pandas, numpy, scikit-learn

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

##  Future Improvements

- Implement feature importance analysis
- Use precision/recall and ROC-AUC metrics
- Try hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV)
